time is up now.  Great exercise.

CSS could really use some help...  (probably should have used bootstrap or similar)

## Need to find a way to let the buttons access the object methods. 
I would have much preferred to use classes and objects but they did not work with button functions. I can't make person Alice and then have the button call 
Alice.Buy()
Arrays used instead, even though they do not make the best code. 

## A good css template could be useful. 
For future projects I should make generic CSS templates.

## Chart template code would be nice
I need to find chart template code. 

## I don't fully understand react yet...
React or Node seem like they would be WAYYY better for a long term version of this task. It would be useful to put this info in DB instead of client side. 
I don't trust my react skills for a timed task yet

## NOTE TO SELF....finish learning React
